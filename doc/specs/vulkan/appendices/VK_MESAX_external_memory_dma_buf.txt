A dma_buf is a type of file descriptor, defined by the Linux kernel, that
allows sharing memory across kernel device drivers and across processes.

This extension enables applications to import a dma_buf as
slink:VkDeviceMemory; to export slink:VkDeviceMemory as a dma_buf; and to
create slink:VkBuffer and slink:VkImage objects that can: be bound to that
memory.

=== Version History

 * Revision 0.4, 2017-02-27 (Chad Versace)
    - When sharing an external handle, the pname:driverUUID must be identical.
      Drop that requirement for dma_bufs.
    - When importing an opaque fd, the memory must have been allocated on the
      same underlying physical device as the importing sname:VkDevice.  Drop
      that requirement for dma_bufs.

 * Revision 0.3, 2017-02-16 (Chad Versace)
    - Replace vendor prefix EXT with MESAX because this is an experimental
      extension.

 * Revision 0.2, 2016-12-08 (Chad Versace)
    - Split into VK_EXT_external_memory_dma_buf and
      VK_EXT_external_image_dma_buf.

 * Revision 0.1, 2012-12-02 (Chad Versace)
    - Initial draft
